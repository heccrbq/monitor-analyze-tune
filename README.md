  Remote Diagnostics Agent (RDA):  
    RDA includes a suite of data collection and diagnostic scripts that aid in analysis and support of
    Oracle products. Use of these tools helps you more efficiently optimize system performance and
    security, as well as manage pre-installation, upgrade, and setup activities.
    • Automated resolution by enabling self service problem diagnosis.
    • Pre-installation validation checks to avoid error during installation.
    • Bundled with on-board tools (Network Advisor, Ora-600, and RAC and EM Post checks).
    
  Operating System Watcher (OSW):
    OSW is a collection of UNIX shell scripts intended to collect and archive operating system and
    network metrics to aid in diagnosing performance issues. OSW operates as a set of background
    processes on the server and gathers OS data, invoking such Unix utilities as vmstat, netstat and
    iostat.
    • Collects specific data using Unix operating system diagnostic utilities.
    • Controls data collector processes to collect specific data, timestamp the data output, and
    append the data to pre-generated and unique named files.
    • Invokes distinct operating system utilities with defined background process as data collectors.
    
  PL/SQL Tuning Scripts:
    The PL/SQL tuning scripts are a set of tools used to diagnose performance related issues.
    • PL/SQL Profiler – identifies lines of PL/SQL code which are taking longer to process.
    • SQLTXPLAIN Plan - generates comprehensive reports, including the explain plan for a given
    SQL statement, cost-based optimizer statistics for the objects accessed by the statement, and
    details of related objects.
    • TRCANLZR - Interprets raw SQL trace and generates a comprehensive HTML report with
    performance related details.
